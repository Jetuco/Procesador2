ERROR: at 150 ns(10000): Iteration limit 10000 is reached. Possible zero delay oscillation detected where simulation can not advance in time because signals can not resolve to a stable value in File "D:/Users/Jehison/Documents/UTP/Sexto Semestre/Arquitectura de Computadores/Procesador/multiplexor.vhd" Line 49. Please correct this code in order to advance past the current simulation time.
